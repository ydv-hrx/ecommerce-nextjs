## What’s inside

Explore `src/app` for route structure; dynamic shop content includes routes such as `/shop/[slug]`.

---

## Learning goals you might pursue

- Routing and layouts with the App Router
- Shared state patterns (e.g. cart / wishlist / compare contexts in `src/components/header`)
- Composition of large page templates and reusable sections
- Styling with Bootstrap alongside other UI libraries
- Preparing a real project: API routes, database, auth, and deployment are **not** the focus of this demo repo
